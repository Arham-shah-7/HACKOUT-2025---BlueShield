Coastal Threat Alert System
Description:
Coastal areas are vital for blue carbon storage but face threats like storm surges, coastal 
erosion, pollution, and illegal activities. This problem is to build a
comprehensive early warning and alerting platform that collects data from physical sensors 
(e.g., tide gauges, weather stations), satellite feeds, and historical records. Using AI/ML, it 
should analyse trends and detect anomalies or patterns that indicate looming threatsâ€”such 
as rising sea levels, algal blooms, illegal dumping, or cyclonic
activity. The system must disseminate actionable alerts via SMS, app notifications, and web 
dashboards to the appropriate authorities and potentially exposed communities.
